# Rules
* Always Do One Extremely Intense Set
* Regular Sets
  * 7-10 reps.
* Negative Sets
  * 6-8 reps
  * You need one or two spotters to perform most negative-only exercises. If you don't have spotters, be creative, but be safe.
  * Load the bar or machine with 30 to 40 percent more resistance than you could regularly handle. 
  * Lower the resistance slowly back to the starting position in 4 to 8 seconds, and repeat the procedures for 6 to 8 controlled negative-only repetitions. 
  * Discontinue a negative-only exercise when you are unable to lower weight in 3 seconds.
* Once you can perform the maximum of a rep range in good form, add 5% more weight the next time you do the exercise.
* Attempt constantly to increase the number of repetitions or amount of weight, or both. 
* Never sacrifice form in the attempt to make progress.
* Resting no more than one minute between sets. 
* Strive to decrese rest periods to 30 seconds.
* Keep track of each workout. Log every date, exercise, order, resistance, repetitions, and overall training time â€“ of each workout.
